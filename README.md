The Digital Linguistics (DLx) Concordance library is a Node.js library for performing concordance-related tasks on [corpora][corpus] (collections of texts in a language) which are formatted according to the [Data Format for Digital Linguistics][DaFoDiL] (<abbr title='Data Format for Digital Linguistics'>DaFoDiL</abbr>) (a JSON-based format). It is useful for anybody doing research involving linguistic corpora. If your data are not yet in DaFoDiL format, there are several converters available [here][converters].

**NOTE:** _This project is still in initial development phases, but should be ready for initial release by the end of September 2019._
